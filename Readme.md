***Photograph your Revit Families/Projects with ease.***

 
## 📋 Summary

![Ribbon](src/Addin/Resources/Ribbon.JPG)

Kompano is an architect. Over time, he has realized that he has over 200 Revit families in his repositories and directories. He hardly uses some of them, not out of choice but by circumstance. Opening each and every Revit family to check how it looks is a tedious process that Kompano has no time for.

Additionally, Kompano intends to create his BIM portfolio. He has a wide array of over 120 models completed over the years to select samples from. Kompano cannot fathom opening each one individually, let alone the tedious process of exporting images. He needs a quick solution.

This tool, named after Kompano, simplifies the visualization process of Revit families and projects. It auto-opens up to 100 Revit families/projects, creates stunning and consistent isometric visuals, gathers the visuals into one folder, and finally auto closes the files all within a timeframe of 5 minutes!


## 📦 Some feature include:

- Auto open Revit families/projects from the search directory.
- Auto create a 3D view.
- Auto adjust the settings of the 3D view styles to suite your preference i.e.   visual style & scale.
- Auto Adjust the 3D orientation to maintain consistency.
- Auto export the images in high resolution to your preferred directory.
- Auto close revit families/projects.
- Settings command to adjust views settings to user's preference

## 📦 Future updates will include:
- Custom Graphic styles options to select from such as blue print effect, black and white Effect, white clay render
- Accommodate revit files.
